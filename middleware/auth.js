/**
 * auth.js (middleware)
 * 
 * This middleware ensures that certain routes of our application are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users.
 * When a request is made to a protected route:
 * 1. This middleware checks for the presence of a token in the request headers.
 * 2. If a token is found, it is verified using a secret key.
 * 3. If the token is valid, the request is allowed to proceed; otherwise, an error is thrown.
 * 
 * Key components include:
 * - Token extraction from the 'Authorization' header.
 * - Token verification using the JSON Web Token (JWT) library.
 * - Addition of the user's decoded data to the request object for subsequent middleware or controllers.
 * 
 * This acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only authenticated requests can interact with protected endpoints.
